# MVP For a node-tree-based CMS
  - one layout
  - Text widget
  - Frontend rendering of all the widgets
  - node reordering
  - node re-rooting (moving a node up/down in the tree, from the left column to
    the right column, for example) (this seems hard)
  - Image widget with file upload, or some other widget that makes it seem like
    less of a toy
