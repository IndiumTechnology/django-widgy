django-widgy
============

django-widgy is a heterogeneous tree editor for Django built on top of
django-treebeard_. Where Treebeard provides tools for working with tree
structures for one model, Widgy enables you to have tree structures with many
different types of models all together. This makes Widgy well-suited for
working with structures like rich HTML trees. Widgy supports Django 1.4+.

Widgy was originally created for powerful content management, but it can have
many different uses.
