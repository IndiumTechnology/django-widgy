Widgy Mezzanine
===============

This app provides integration with the Mezzanine_ project. Widgy Mezzanine uses
Mezzanine for site structure and Widgy for page content. It does this by
providing a subclass of Mezzanine's Page model called
:class:`~widgy.contrib.widgy_mezzanine.models.WidgyPage` which delegates to
Page Builder for all content.
